# Audit Logging System Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive audit logging system that tracks all data changes across the J11 Production Manager application. This system provides complete visibility into who made changes, when they were made, and what exactly changed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Table**: `audit_logs` with comprehensive tracking fields
- **Fields Tracked**:
  - `table_name`: Which table was modified
  - `record_id`: Which specific record was modified
  - `action`: Type of operation (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - `field_name`: Specific field changed (for updates)
  - `old_value`: Previous value before change
  - `new_value`: New value after change
  - `user_id`: ID of user who made the change
  - `user_email`: Email of user (for redundancy)
  - `ip_address`: IP address of the request
  - `user_agent`: Browser/client information
  - `timestamp`: When the change occurred

### 2. Audit Service (`auditService.ts`)
- **Core Functions**:
  - `logAuditChange()`: Log a single field change
  - `logAuditChanges()`: Compare old/new records and log all changes
  - `logRecordCreation()`: Log when new records are created
  - `logRecordDeletion()`: Log when records are deleted
  - `getAuditLogsForRecord()`: Get audit history for a specific record
  - `getAuditLogsForUser()`: Get all changes made by a specific user
  - `getRecentAuditLogs()`: Get recent system-wide audit logs

### 3. API Endpoints (`/api/audit`)
- `GET /api/audit/record/:tableName/:recordId` - Get audit logs for a specific record
- `GET /api/audit/user/:userId` - Get audit logs for a specific user (admin only)
- `GET /api/audit/recent` - Get recent system-wide audit logs (admin only)
- `GET /api/audit/my-actions` - Get current user's audit logs

### 4. CRUD Operations Integration
We've integrated audit logging into all CRUD operations for:

#### Jobs (`/api/jobs`)
- ✅ **CREATE**: Logs when new jobs are created
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Tracks field-level changes to jobs
- ✅ **DELETE**: Logs when jobs are deleted

#### Projects (`/api/projects`)
- ✅ **CREATE**: Logs when new projects are created
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Tracks field-level changes to projects
- ✅ **DELETE**: Logs when projects are deleted

#### Clients (`/api/clients`)
- ✅ **CREATE**: Logs when new clients are created
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Tracks field-level changes to clients
- ✅ **ARCHIVE**: Logs when clients are archived/unarchived
- ✅ **DELETE**: Logs when clients are deleted (with cascading data)

## Technical Details

### Change Tracking Methodology
1. **Before Updates**: We fetch the existing record before making changes
2. **Field-Level Comparison**: The system compares old vs new values for each field
3. **Selective Logging**: Only changed fields are logged (timestamps excluded)
4. **JSON Serialization**: Complex values are stored as JSON strings

### Security & User Attribution
- All changes include user ID and email from the JWT token
- IP address and User-Agent are captured for additional context
- Proper permission checking ensures only authorized users can make changes

### Database Performance
- Optimized indexes on frequently queried fields:
  - `table_name` + `record_id` (composite index)
  - `user_id`
  - `timestamp` (descending for recent queries)
  - `action`

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Audit Logs
```bash
# Get all changes to job #123
GET /api/audit/record/jobs/123

# Get all changes made by user #5 
GET /api/audit/user/5

# Get recent system activity (last 200 changes)
GET /api/audit/recent?limit=200

# Get my own audit trail
GET /api/audit/my-actions
```

### Audit Log Response Format
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "tableName": "jobs",
  "recordId": 123,
  "action": "UPDATE",
  "fieldName": "status",
  "oldValue": "\"in-progress\"",
  "newValue": "\"completed\"",
  "userId": 5,
  "userEmail": "user@example.com",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

### Additional Tables to Add Audit Logging:
1. **Contacts**: Add to contact CRUD operations
2. **Job Statuses**: Add to job status management
3. **Holidays**: Add to holiday management
4. **Lead Times**: Add to lead time management
5. **User Management**: Add to user/role changes
6. **User Column Preferences**: Track UI preference changes

### Frontend Integration:
1. Create audit log viewer components
2. Add "View History" buttons to records
3. Show recent changes in dashboards
4. Add admin audit management interface

### Advanced Features:
1. **Audit Log Retention**: Implement automatic cleanup of old logs
2. **Export Functionality**: Allow exporting audit logs for compliance
3. **Real-time Notifications**: Alert users to important changes
4. **Audit Dashboard**: Visual representation of system activity

## Database Migration
The audit logs table has been created with the migration script:
```sql
-- Run this command to apply the migration:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/src/db/audit_logs_migration.sql
```

## Testing the System
1. **Create a new job** - Check audit logs for creation entry
2. **Update the job** - Verify field-level change tracking
3. **Delete the job** - Confirm deletion is logged
4. **View audit logs** - Use the API endpoints to retrieve logs

## Compliance & Benefits
- **Accountability**: Know exactly who made what changes
- **Debugging**: Track down when issues were introduced
- **Compliance**: Meet audit requirements for data changes
- **Security**: Detect unauthorized modifications
- **Analytics**: Understand usage patterns and user behavior

The audit logging system is now fully functional and integrated into the core CRUD operations of the application!
